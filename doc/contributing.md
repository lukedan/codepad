# Contributing

First of all, thank you and welcome to the contributing guide!

Since codepad does not yet have any binary distributions, the first step towards contributing would be building the program and running it for yourself, following the [instructions here](build.md).

After getting it up and running, you can report bugs and suggest new features based on your experience by creating issues, or directly contribute code to the project. Here are some useful resources:

- [The Architecture of Codepad](architecture.md): A short document outlining the components of the project. For more detailed documentation, you can build the documentation using doxygen, or read the code directly.
- [TODO list](todo.md): A list of to-do items. If you're interested in a specific item but would like more information, you can create an issue about it.
- [Coding guidelines](coding_guidelines.md): Be sure to follow the coding guidelines while writing code for codepad.
